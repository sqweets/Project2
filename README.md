After researching multiple sites for temperature data we found the OpenWeatherMap to have some historical data that was available for purchase at $10 per city of interest. This caused us to pivot away from this pursuit and we were unable to find another historical weather resource that was available due to time constraints. However, our data set concerning tornados was more available; we therefore went ahead with the tornado data to reveal their occurrences, frequency, and intensity.

Investigating the tornado data was a portion of our beginning project. We were hoping to incorporate temperature change to see if a temperature change increase over time could be influencing a shift in tornado alley. 

This was created to visualize the distribution of tornados by decade where the circle size and color indicated the tornado
F/EF scale value (0-5).

(Note that the files for this had to be in the /docs folder on the master branch for github pages to work.)

Tableau was used as a data munging tool and to show how data can be visualized without the use of coding. Data cleanup, munging, and insight all occurred in Tableau. We showed several visualizations, including:
1) All tornadoes and their associated # of deaths from 1950-Present. A filter could be used to move decade to decade. Tornadoes that caused a large number of deaths had large circles on their lat/long location within the map.
2) A bubble chart showed that there was no correlation between a tornadoe's width and it's level of intensity (F level).
3) A heat map that showed property damager per state over the 1950-1989 time period. After 1989, the methodology changes and the conversion of earlier data to conform with that methodology was outside the scope of this project.
4) A bar and dot chart showed that, over time, the # of tornadoes has increased, but the overall avg. intensity has decreased.
5) A worksheet could pull information off of a website in order to look into the background off a tornado.

The data interacted througha actions and filters.

-	Created a dynamic page which displays the current News and the hyperlink.

-	Displayed statewise data tornado data. The details displated tornado each decade and frequency from 0 to 5.
