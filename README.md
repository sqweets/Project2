Investigating the tornado data was a portion of our beginning project. We were hoping to incorporate temperature change to see if a temperature change increase over time could be influencing a shift in tornado alley. 

After researching multiple sites for temperature data we found the OpenWeatherMap to have some historical data that was available for purchase at $10 per city of interest. This caused us to pivot away from this pursuit and we were unable to find another historical weather resource that was available due to time constraints. However, our data set concerning tornados was more available; we therefore went ahead with the tornado data to reveal their occurrences, frequency, and intensity.



This was created to visualize the distribution of tornados by decade where the circle size and color indicated the tornado
F/EF scale value (0-5).

(Note that the files for this had to be in the /docs folder on the master branch for github pages to work.)
