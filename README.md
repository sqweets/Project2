<b>Leaflet app</b>  (/docs)

This was created to visualize the distribution of tornados by decade where the circle size and color indicated the tornado
F/EF scale value (0-5).

This can be accessed here: https://sqweets.github.io/Project2-TornadoAlley/.
(Note that the files for this had to be in the /docs folder on the master branch for github pages to work.)
